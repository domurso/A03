I didnt use webstorm as I just use my terminal for most of my coding
but here is a definition
WebStorm comes with many powerful tools to assure the high quality of your code base.

Dozens of built-in inspections are enabled by default. These static code analysis tools help you find probable bugs, detect performance issues and improve the overall code structure right as you write the code. You can also use the integrated code quality tools: JSHint or JSLint.

Inspections are available for all languages supported by WebStorm, including JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Less, Sass, TypeScript, CoffeeScript and Dart.

Built-in inspections help you detect errors and potential problems, from obvious ones like a missing semicolon to more complex issues like unresolved methods in JavaScript and mismatching types when type info is available.


Git
Git is a base for websites such as github and other sites that use branching repos that all stem from the same underlying code but have indivitual changes made by a variety of users

github
is a website that provides a clear UI to see repos and changes that have been made to them, while you do need an account to use github you technically do not need to use there website as it is only for the UI
<h1> Glossary</h1>
<ul>
<li><B>Branch</B>:  reates a branch for the repo different branches all stem from the same idea</li>
<li><B>Clone</B>: To clone a repository means to duplicate and download everything in the repository. </li>
<li><b>Commit</B>: creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times. </li>
<li><b>Fetch</B>: git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. </li>
<li><B>GIT</B>: The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. </li>
<li><B>Github</B>: At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. </li>
<li><B>Merge</B>:When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit. </li>
<li><B>Merge Conflict</B> when merge runs into an error </li>
<li><B>Push</B>: push any commits to the branch </li>
<li><B>Pull</B>: pull any recent pushes from the branch</li>
<li><B>Remote</B>: can work on file anywhere</li>
<li><B>Repository</B>: A GIT repository allows performing various operations on it to create different versions of a project. These operations include the addition of files, creating new repositories, committing an action, deleting a repository, etc. These modifications will result in the creation of different versions of a project</li>
</ul>
